This is NOT a CSS framework. It is merely a starting point for CSS projects. It is a sampling of techniques and tools I've found to work well together.


Usage: 

From the head of an HTML or XHTML document call the layout.css and print.css file as linked stylesheets, and if necessary the ie7.css and/or ie6.css stylesheet using conditional comments. 

These styles are designed to work best with an XHTML 1.0 Strict Doctype. There are many advantages to using that particular doctype that I won't go into here.

The print.css stylesheet is for use in print media only. Screen.css is intended for use in most other media.

An example reference to these stylesheets from the Head of an HTML document would look like this:

<!-- stylesheets -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="stylesheets/layout.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="print" href="stylesheets/print.css" />

<!--[if lte IE 7]>
	<style type="text/css" media="screen">
		@import "stylesheets/ie7.css";
	</style>
<![endif]-->

<!--[if lte IE 6]>
	<style type="text/css" media="screen">
		@import "stylesheets/ie6.css";
	</style>
<![endif]-->
