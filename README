This is intended to be a starting point for CSS projects -- a sampling of techniques and tools I've found to work well together.



Misc files:

font-stack.rtf is a rich-text file for comparing the font stacks. Requires all the fonts in the stack to be loaded on a computer to actually compare them.

test.html is an example XHTML document delineating the variety of elements that the stylesheet affects for a simple visual reference. 



Usage: 

From the head of an HTML or XHTML document reference the layout.css (screen media) and print.css (print media) files and, if necessary, the ie7.css and/or ie6.css stylesheet using conditional comments. 

These styles are designed to work best with an XHTML 1.0 Strict Doctype and a semantics-based design technique. The package uses a normalizing stylesheet and the address, b, big, caption, cite, code, dfn, em, i, small, strong, th, u, and var elements have their default styling completely removed. Other elements are mostly reset.

div is treated as a purely structural element and lists are setup to require styling to serve as textual lists.

The Typography stylesheet sets up a Baseline Grid and defines screen-friendly font stacks including a humanist sans-serif stack, a serif stack and a monospace font stack.

There are a few extra non-semantic hooks for better typographic styling including a definition for the .amp class (for ampersands customization) and a .caps class definition for setting text in all caps.

The effects of these stylesheets and the methods used to import them can and will have odd effects (or just flat out won't work) on Netscape Communicator and IE 5 Mac. At one point this was intentional but now its just worth mentioning.



Example stylesheet definition to be placed in the <head> of an HTML document:

<!-- stylesheets -->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="stylesheets/layout.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="print" href="stylesheets/print.css" />

<!--[if lte IE 7]>
	<style type="text/css" media="screen">
		@import "stylesheets/ie7.css";
	</style>
<![endif]-->

<!--[if lte IE 6]>
	<style type="text/css" media="screen">
		@import "stylesheets/ie6.css";
	</style>
<![endif]-->
